1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?

        A) Task should be a string becuase the only thing class does is it stores a name and does not provide any useful abstraction. 
3. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
