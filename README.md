1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?

        A) Task should be a string becuase the only thing the class does is store a name and does not provide any useful abstraction. 
3. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?

        B) A command to modify a task.
           A command to assign ownership to a task.
        
            By adding a new variable to the class, like assignee, the class is handling more 
            then just one item. So the project class will allow us to create multiple projects 
            that have a name and a person who is assigned to the project. This will create 
            structure for our program and when more features are added which need different 
            attributes, they would be easy to add to the class without affecting any of the 
            previously written code.
